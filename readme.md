This is a version of the mobile hit Jetpack Joyride made in C++ using OpenGL.

This game has 2 levels, 
A standard level 1, which ends with a showdown with the level boss, Viserion.
This is followed up by an indefinitely long surprise level two which is sure to boggle up your senses :)

( Clue : Let's see how easy it is guide movement tied upside down )

The following enemies have been implemented..

Firelines : Going through which kills you instantaneously. Will encounter these until the end of the game. Randomly generated and can be angled.

Firebeams : Hover around and follow player, and fire a horizontal beam after a fixed interval. Be in it's sight, and you are sure to be reduced to a crisp. Disapper giving way to Boss.

Viserion : Boss. Legendary Ice Dragon. Need I say more? 

Boomerang : Watchout for these little blades swishwing all around you. Lethal if they hit head and neck regions. Random generation. 



Power-ups to help you get through this nightmare! 

Power-ups are randomly generated and float around, trying to evade caputre by zigzagging ofc 

Three kinds of powerups : 
1) Bonus coins
2) Speed boost
3) Shield ! Mind you shield only protects you from attacks coming from forward, i.e whatever it can block. Boomerangs can get past it because of how evasive it's motion is. Dragon flame, and firelines cannot though :)

In addition, waterballoons to fight off firelines.


Controls :

Arrows : Left and right movement 
Space : Fire jetpack
W : Throw waterballoons
